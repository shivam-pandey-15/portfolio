# Research: 1.3 Search vs Discovery vs Recommendation

## The Confusion
These three terms are often used interchangeably, but they solve different problems.

---

## Definitions

### Search
**User knows what they want.**
- Input: Explicit query ("running shoes")
- Output: Ranked list of matching items
- Goal: **Precision** — return exactly what they asked for
- Success: User finds the specific item quickly

### Recommendation
**System suggests what user might like.**
- Input: User history, context, behavior
- Output: Personalized suggestions
- Goal: **Engagement** — increase time on site, cross-sell
- Success: User discovers items they didn't know they wanted

### Discovery
**User is exploring, not hunting.**
- Input: Categories, filters, browsing
- Output: Navigation and filtering UX
- Goal: **Exploration** — help user narrow down choices
- Success: User finds something interesting through browsing

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | Search | Recommendation | Discovery |
|--------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| User Intent | High (knows what) | Low (open to ideas) | Medium (knows category) |
| Input | Query text | User history | Clicks, filters |
| Personalization | Low-Medium | Very High | Medium |
| Latency Sensitivity | Very High | Medium | Low |
| Success Metric | CTR, ZRR | Engagement, CVR | Browse depth |
| Example | "iPhone 15 case" | "Because you bought..." | Browse Electronics > Phones |

## When to Use Which

### Search: The Direct Path
Best for:
- Users with specific intent
- Transactional queries ("buy X")
- Repeat purchases ("reorder contacts")
- Research queries ("compare X vs Y")

**Example UX:**
```
User → Types "noise cancelling headphones" 
     → Gets ranked results 
     → Filters by price 
     → Buys
```

### Recommendations: The Suggestion Engine
Best for:
- Homepage personalization
- "You might also like" sections
- Email campaigns
- Cart upsells

**Example UX:**
```
User → Views product page for headphones
     → Sees "Customers also bought: headphone stand, case"
     → Adds case to cart
```

### Discovery: The Exploration Flow
Best for:
- New users who don't know what's available
- Window shoppers
- Category exploration
- Gift shoppers

**Example UX:**
```
User → Clicks "Electronics" 
     → Clicks "Audio"
     → Clicks "Headphones" 
     → Filters "Wireless" 
     → Browses options
```

## The Hybrid Reality

In practice, these overlap:

### Search + Recommendation
- Query: "headphones"
- Results: Personalized based on user's past purchases
- "You searched for headphones. Based on your music preferences, we suggest..."

### Search + Discovery
- Query: "dress"
- Results + filter sidebar (color, size, occasion)
- User refines through facets

### All Three Combined
Netflix is the best example:
1. **Search**: User types "comedy"
2. **Discovery**: Browse by genre, trending
3. **Recommendation**: "Because you watched..."

---

## Architecture Implications

### Search Engine Requirements
- Fast retrieval (inverted index)
- Ranking by relevance
- Typo tolerance, synonyms
- Filter and facet support

### Recommendation Engine Requirements
- User feature store
- Item embeddings
- Real-time personalization
- Collaborative filtering or content-based

### Discovery Requirements
- Category hierarchy
- Filter/facet indexing
- Browse path optimization
- Merchandising rules

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Treating Search as Just Retrieval
"We have Elasticsearch, search is done."
Reality: Search needs ranking, personalization, and continuous improvement.

### Mistake 2: Over-Personalizing Search
"Let's show different results for every user."
Reality: User expects consistency. "iPhone" should show iPhones, regardless of who searches.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Discovery
"Users will just search for what they want."
Reality: New users don't know your catalog. Discovery helps them explore.

### Mistake 4: Separate Teams, No Coordination
Search team optimizes for CTR. Recommendations team optimizes for engagement.
Result: Conflicting experiences.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Search = High intent, precision-focused**
2. **Recommendations = Low intent, engagement-focused**
3. **Discovery = Medium intent, exploration-focused**
4. **Best products combine all three** with a unified experience
5. **Don't over-personalize search** — users expect consistent results
