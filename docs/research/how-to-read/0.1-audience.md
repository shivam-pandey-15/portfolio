# Research: 0.1 Who This Is For

## Primary Audiences

### 1. Software Engineers (Backend/Platform)
**Profile:**
- 2-5 years experience building APIs and services
- Knows databases, REST, microservices
- Has "used" Elasticsearch/Algolia but doesn't understand the internals

**What they want:**
- Move from "consumer of search API" to "builder of search infrastructure"
- Understand trade-offs: Why does ranking matter more than retrieval?
- Debug production issues: Why is P99 latency spiking?

**Pain points:**
- Tutorials show `index.add(doc)` but not "what happens when you have 100M docs"
- No guidance on schema design, sharding decisions, or reindexing strategies

---

### 2. ML Engineers / Data Scientists
**Profile:**
- Strong in embeddings, LLMs, recommendation systems
- Weak in systems engineering (distributed systems, caching, latency)

**What they want:**
- How to take a model from Jupyter notebook to production search
- Understand the full pipeline: Retrieval → Ranking → Serving
- Learn about feature stores, model serving latency, and where ML fits in

**Pain points:**
- "My model has great NDCG offline but CTR is flat in production"
- Don't understand the retrieval bottleneck (can't rank what you don't retrieve)

---

### 3. Product Managers (Technical)
**Profile:**
- Owns the search experience for an e-commerce or SaaS product
- Reports to leadership on search KPIs

**What they want:**
- Vocabulary to communicate with engineering: "Let's improve recall on long-tail queries"
- Understand why some improvements are 2-week projects and others are 6-month investments
- Framework for prioritizing: relevance vs latency vs personalization

**Pain points:**
- "Why can't we just use ChatGPT for search?"
- "Why is adding synonyms taking 3 sprints?"

---

### 4. Founders / CTOs
**Profile:**
- Building a product where search is core (marketplace, knowledge base, etc.)
- Need to make build-vs-buy decisions

**What they want:**
- When to use Algolia vs Elasticsearch vs build custom
- What's the minimum viable search stack?
- How does search affect retention and revenue?

**Pain points:**
- Underestimating search complexity → "It's just a text box"
- Over-engineering too early → "Let's build our own vector DB"

---

## Who This Is NOT For
- Complete beginners (need basic programming first)
- Academic IR researchers (this is practical, not theoretical)
- People looking for copy-paste tutorials without understanding
